      <h4 style="font-family:'Avenir Next'; font-size:16px; font-weight:400;color:#696969;padding-top:20px">Today Athelas began deployment of our <a href="/" style="color:#1c90e9">portable diagnostic device</a> through select hospitals for trials. We also put the device up for specific pre-orders on an individual basis. Silicon Valley’s place in the medical system has been one plagued with controversy in the recent past [1,2,3] - a reputation that is hard to fix. 
      </br>
      </br>
      Developing any healthcare product is an inherent commitment to accuracy and transparency for your customers and users. That’s why, from day one, we’re putting out a manifesto of openness regarding our operations. Furthermore, we have embraced (and will continue to) the FDA with open arms. Our goals as organizations are aligned; hence, it is our job to make it easy for the regulatory body to conduct due diligence. So here are our core beliefs:
      </br>
      </br>
      <strong>1. All <a href="/data" style="color:#1c90e9">Data</a> is Open and Public</strong>

      <br>
      </br>

      Any data collected regarding production device trials, accuracies, and comparisons to gold standards will immediately be made public. It’s useless to us if our device doesn’t meet gold standard accuracies and dangerous for users. Thus, we want to be held fully accountable by the public - ultimately the people who will define the worth of our company. Please view the ‘Data’ section of our website for recurrently updated archives of data. Our first data dump is scheduled for July 20th, after the initial deployment batch data is processed and uploaded.

      <br>
      </br>

      <strong>2. A commitment to open sourcing our <a href="/technology" style="color:#1c90e9">technologies</a> + methodologies as we cycle through them.</strong>

      <br>
      </br>

      Competitive innovation only results in betterment for the end user and the world overall. When we’re working on something that’s going to eventually affect millions every single day, we want the best possible technology in-place for everyone: not necessarily just our company’s users. Thus, from day 1, our commitment is to de-privatize key components of our IP over time so that the field as a whole can move forward. <br></br>

      Everyone benefits when we’re open with the way we progress. We put our confidence in the fact that Athelas will continue to innovate at a rate fast enough that even by opening big chunks of our methodologies and techniques over time, we’ll remain the choice for customers. <br></br>

      We’re incredibly lucky to have investors who share this vision - it’s a risky one, but one we’re confident will pay it’s dividends for us as a company by forcing us to continue to drive innovation while also incubating a healthy ecosystem of intelligent medical devices.

      <br>
      </br>

      <strong>3. Scientific innovation and sound research methodologies above all else.</strong>
      <br>
      </br>
      We believe companies fail when they stop innovating and focus on peripheral metrics. The key will always be making devices that can do more; faster, cheaper, and more intelligently than anything else ever built. In order to ensure this, we need to place our focus on innovating. At the end of the day our belief is that the market will inherently embrace the best technology.<br></br>

      To show that these aren’t just empty words, we’ve gone ahead and publicly released the <a href="paper.pdf" style="color:#1c90e9">original paper</a> writeup behind the project: what got it all started. This is near and dear to my heart; I wrote it as a senior in high school, and remember hacking away day and night to get the project to work. Research is meant to be open; it’s the only way we progress. As a company we’ve obviously moved considerably forward since it (more than 1.5 years of work), but it shows our roots and direction. I hope that it can serve as a simple example for anyone who wants to work on similar projects. It’s important that we innovate with an inherent aim to improve the quality and relevance of the human species, and getting more people to focus on the big problems is the only way to do that.
